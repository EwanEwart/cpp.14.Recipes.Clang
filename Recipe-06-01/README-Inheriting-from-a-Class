C++ allows you to build complex software applications
in a number of ways.

One of the most common
is the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm.

Classes in C++ are used to provide a blueprint for objects
that contain your data and the operations
that can be carried out on that data.

Inheritance takes this a step further
by letting you construct complex hierarchies of classes.

The C++ language provides various different features
you can use to organise your code
in a logical manner.

Recipe 6-1. Inheriting from a Class
===================================

Problem
-------
Youâ€™re writing a program
that has a natural -- is-a relationship --
between objects and would like
to reduce code duplication.

Solution
--------
Inheriting a class from a parent class
allows you to add your code  to the parent
and share it between multiple derived types.

How It Works
------------
In C++, you can inherit one class from another.

The inheriting class
gains all the properties of the base class.

Listing 6-1 shows an example of two classes
that inherit from a shared parent.

....

Listing 6-1. Class Inheritance

...
The Vehicle class contains a --member variable--
to store --the number of wheels-- the vehicle has.

This value is initialised to 0 by default
or is set in the constructor.

Vehicle is followed by another class named Car.
The Car class
contains only a constructor
that is used to call the constructor
for Vehicle.

The Car constructor
passes the number 4 into the Vehicle constructor
and therefore sets m_NumberOfWheels to 4.

The Motorcycle class also contains just a constructor,
but it passes 2 to the Vehicle constructor.

Because both Car and Motorcycle inherit from the Vehicle class,
they both inherit its properties.

They both contain a variable
to hold the number of wheels,
and they will both have a method
to retrieve the number of wheels.

You can see this in the main function,
where GetNumberOfWheels is called
on both the myCar object
and the myMotorcycle object.

Figure 6-1 shows the output generated by this code.

The Car class and the Motorcycle class
both inherit the properties of Vehicle
and both set the appropriate number of wheels
in their constructor.
