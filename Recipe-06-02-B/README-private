The private Access Specifier
----------------------------
Instead of making variables public,
you can make them private
and provide public accessors to them.

Listing 6-3 shows the use of a private member variable.

Listing 6-3. The private Access Specifier

Listing 6-3 shows the use of the private access specifier
with the m_NumberOfWheels variable.

The Car and Motorcycle classes
can no longer access the m_NumberOfWheels variable directly;
therefore, the Vehicle class
provides a method
to initialise the variable through its constructor.

This makes the classes a little harder to work with,
but adds the benefit
of not allowing any external code
direct access to the member variable.

You can see this in the main function:
the code must get the number of wheels
through the GetNumberOfWheels accessor method.
