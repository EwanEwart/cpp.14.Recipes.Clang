Recipe 6-2. Controlling Access to Member Variables and Methods in Derived Classes
=================================================================================

Problem
-------
Your derived class needs to be able to access the fields in its parent.

Solution
--------
C++ access modifiers have an effect on the way
variables can be accessed in derived classes.

Using the correct access modifier is essential
in properly constructing a class hierarchy.

How It Works
------------

The -- public -- Access Specifier
---------------------------------
The public access specifier
grants public access
to a variable or method in a class.

This applies equally to member variables and methods.
You can see this clearly in Listing 6-2.
...
Any variables with public access
can be accessed by a derived class.

Both the Car constructor
and the Motorcycle constructor
take advantage of this
and set the number of wheels they have appropriately.

The downside is
that other code can also access the public member variables.

You can see this in the main function:
the m_NumberOfWheels is read and assigned
to both the myCar object and the myMotorcycle object.

Figure 6-2 shows the output generated by this code.
