Listing 3-5. A makefile that Defines NDEBUG

main: main.cpp

clang++ -D NDEBUG -O2 -Werror -std=c++1y main.cpp -o main

At that point
you will also need to wrap any code,
which creates or uses any variables of the StringLiteral type.

You should see a problem at this point,
using this define means
that you cannot have any string literals in your program.

A better solution is shown in Listing 3-6
