Recipe 6-5. Preventing Method Overwrites
========================================
Problem
-------
You have a method
that you don’t wish to be overwritten
by deriving classes.

Solution
--------
You can use the --final-- keyword
to prevent classes from overwriting a method.

How It Works
------------
The --final-- keyword informs the compiler
that you don’t want a virtual method
to be overwritten by a deriving class.

Listing 6-8 shows an example of using the --final-- keyword

...

The GetNumberOfWheels method in the Vehicle class
uses the --final-- keyword
to prevent derived classes from trying to overwrite it.

This causes the code in Listing 6-8 to fail to compile,
because the Car class attempts to overwrite GetNumberOfWheels.

You can comment out this method to compile the code.

The --final-- keyword can also stop
further overwrites of a method
in a longer chain.

Listing 6-9 shows how this is possible.
