Recipe 6-7. Multiple Inheritance
================================

Problem
-------
You have a class that you wish to derive from more than one parent

Solution
--------
C++ supports multiple inheritance.

How It Works
------------
You can derive a class from multiple parents
in C++
using a comma-separated list of parent classes.

Listing 6-11 shows how this can be achieved.

Listing 6-11. Multiple Inheritance

...

The Car and Motorcycle classes
both derive from multiple parents.

These classes are now both Vehicles and Printables.

You can see the interplay
between the two parents
in the overwritten Print methods.

These methods
both call the overwritten GetNumberOfWheels method
in Car and Motorcycle.

The main function
accesses the overwritten Print methods
using a pointer to a Printable object,
using polymorphism
to call the correct Print method
and also the correct GetNumberOfWheels method
in Print.

Figure 6-6 shows
that the output from the program is correct.
