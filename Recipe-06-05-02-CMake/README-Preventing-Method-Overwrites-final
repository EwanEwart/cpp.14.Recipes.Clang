Vehicle defines a virtual method
named GetNumberOfWheels
that returns the value 2.

Car overwrites this method to return 4.

This example ignores the fact
that not all cars have four wheels,
and declares
that the method is --final--.

No other classes
deriving from Car
are allowed to overwrite the same method.

This makes sense for the application
if the requirements only require support for four-wheeled cars.

The compiler will throw an error
when it reaches any class
that derives from Car or derives from any other class
that has Car in its hierarchy
and that tries to overwrite the GetNumberOfWheels method.
