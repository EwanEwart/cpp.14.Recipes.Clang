The protected Access Specifier
------------------------------
The protected access specifier
allows for a mix of public and private access specifiers.

It acts like a public specifier
for classes
that derive from the current class,
and it acts like a private specifier
for external code.

Listing 6-4 shows this behaviour.

...

Listing 6-4 shows
that both Car and Motorcycle
can access the m_NumberOfWheels variable directly
from their parent class, Vehicle.

Both classes
set the m_NumberOfWheels variable
in their constructors.

The calling code in the main function
doesnâ€™t have access to this variable
and therefore has to call
the GetNumberOfWheels method
to be able to print this value.
